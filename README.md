# 🏥 MediBuddy Insurance Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on MediBuddy insurance data to understand the key factors influencing **insurance claim amounts and policy decisions**.
Using Python and data visualization techniques, the analysis converts raw healthcare data into **actionable business insights** that can help optimize pricing strategies, risk assessment, and customer segmentation.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

* Identify major factors affecting insurance claim amounts
* Analyze the impact of demographic and lifestyle attributes on policy pricing
* Understand health-related risk indicators such as BMI, age, and smoking habits
* Evaluate opportunities for policy customization and premium discounts
* Support data-driven decision-making for insurance policy extensions

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The project uses two datasets:

* **Medibuddy Personal Details**: Age, Gender, BMI, Smoking Status, Dependents, Region
* **Medibuddy Data Price**: Insurance charges / claim amounts

Both datasets were merged using a common identifier to perform holistic analysis.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
* **Jupyter Notebook**

**Insight:**
Individuals with **overweight and obese BMI categories incur significantly higher insurance charges**, making BMI a strong indicator of health risk.
➡️ Customers with **normal BMI** can be considered for **premium discounts**.

---

### 🚬 2. Smoking Status Impact on Claims

**Insight:**
Smokers consistently show **much higher insurance claim amounts** compared to non-smokers.
➡️ Smoking status should be a **key pricing factor** in insurance policies.

**Insight:**
Insurance charges increase with age, especially after **45 years**, indicating higher medical risk.
➡️ Age-based risk segmentation can improve pricing accuracy.

---

## ✅ Overall Business Findings

* Gender alone has minimal influence on insurance claims
* BMI, smoking status, and age are **primary drivers of insurance cost**
* Customers with more dependents tend to have higher financial exposure
* Geographic region shows variability in claim behavior
* Preventive health incentives such as BMI-based discounts can reduce long-term risk

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **Exploratory Data Analysis** can uncover meaningful healthcare insights and support smarter insurance decisions. The findings help MediBuddy identify high-risk segments, optimize policy pricing, and design customer-centric insurance strategies based on data.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Build a **risk scoring model**
* Predict insurance charges using regression
* Create an interactive dashboard for stakeholders
